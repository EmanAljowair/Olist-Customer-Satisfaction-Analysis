# Olist-Customer-Satisfaction-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores customer satisfaction using the Olist e-commerce dataset. The analysis is conducted over a 2-year period and aims to uncover insights into customer behavior, order trends, and factors influencing satisfaction ratings. By combining exploratory data analysis and machine learning classification, we provide a full-circle understanding of the drivers of customer sentiment.

The project is built on real-world Brazilian e-commerce data but the patterns and findings are universally applicable, as customer satisfaction is a global concern.

## Files
Olist CS analysis.ipynb – EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) notebook that explores patterns in customer ratings and delivery performance.

CLASSIFICATION ML FOR COMMENTS.ipynb – Machine learning classification of customer review comments into issue categories.

Visualization and deep analysis were done in Power BI [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eDVbDtsrMcx0evTLduDNOVbBaIVwlWFH/view?usp=sharing)

## Objectives
- Understand the distribution and impact of customer ratings.

- Investigate how delivery delays and payment methods affect satisfaction.

- Analyze customer review texts and classify them into sentiment categories using ML.



## Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, NLTK)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Machine Learning (TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, etc.)
- Google colab
- zero-shot classification from Hugging Face Transformers

## Key Insights
- Wrong Item Received are one of the biggest contributors to negative reviews.

- Customers generally give 5-star ratings when products arrive on time and as described.

- Behavioral patterns and sentiment analysis techniques used here can be generalized across different e-commerce platforms.
